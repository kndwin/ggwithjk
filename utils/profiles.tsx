    description: `Jaison was born in India but grew up in Sydney. He grew up in a Christian family but only became a Christian himself when he discovered the Bibleâ€™s radical message about the grace of God while listening to a sermon during his lunch break at work. Jaison now loves seeing others from all different backgrounds and age-groups learning about this same grace shown to sinners in the death and resurrection of Christ. He enjoys having a good cold brew coffee with friends and loves watching Marvel movies.

    		Jaison oversees the Engage Youth Ministry, pastors the 5pm congregation and leads the Explore Evangelistic Ministry.`,
