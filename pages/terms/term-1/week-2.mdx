**25** At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them
to little children. **26** Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.

**27** “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

**28** “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. **29** Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. **30** For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
