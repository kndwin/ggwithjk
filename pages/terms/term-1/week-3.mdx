## Passage

<summary>Matthew 12:22-32 (ESV)</summary>

### **Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit**

**22** Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. **23** And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” **24** But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” **25** Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. **26** And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? **27** And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. **28** But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. **29** Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. **30** Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. **31** Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. **32** And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

## Study

### Introduction question

- What are some of the different teachings you’ve heard or read about the Holy Spirit?

### Study

- In pairs, what is the tension in verses 22 to 24?
- Re-read verses 25 to 29, How does Jesus answer the tension?
- In verse 30, we see anyone is either with Jesus or against Jesus. Either scattered or gathered. Again in your pairs, go through the story again and see.

  - who do we think is with Jesus vs against Jesus
    | With Jesus | Against Jesus |
    | ---------- | ------------- |
    | <br /> | |
  - who do we think is gathered vs scattered?
    | Gathered | Scattered |
    | -------- | --------- |
    | <br /> | |

- In the verses 31 and 32, what is forgivable and what isn’t? I’m going to read the verse out loud and give a thumbs up if we think it’s forgivable and thumbs down if we think isn’t
  | | Verse 31 | Verse 32 |
  | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
  | Forgivable | | |
  | Unforgivable |   | |

- (Bonus question if time permits) What does it mean to "Blaspheme against the Holy Spirit"

### Tea break (10 minutes)

### Application

- How would you summarise the passage in one sentence?
- In gendered groups of 3/2, go through the below
  - “Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and blasphemy” - Spend some time confessing our sins to each other and praising God for the forgiveness that Jesus offers
  - “Anyone who is not with me is against me” - Pray for someone who you know do not know Jesus, and that they may come to know him.
  - "but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." - How can we be sure we are not blaspheming against the Spirit?
