<summary>Matthew 13:44-58 (ESV)</summary>

### **The Parable of the Hidden Treasure**

**44** “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

### **The Parable of the Pearl of Great Value**

**45** “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, **46** who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.

### **The Parable of the Net**

**47** “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. **48** When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. **49** So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous **50** and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

### **New and Old Treasures**

**51** “Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” **52** And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”

### **Jesus Rejected at Nazareth**

**53** And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, **54** and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? **55** Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? **56** And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” **57** And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.” **58** And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
