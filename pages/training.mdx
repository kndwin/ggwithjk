# Balancing Self-Care and Service

## Leadership Training and Support Afternoon

### Are you like Craig?

- Like you've got nothing left, but need to keep serving?
- Resentful and bitter - towards people or minitry / programs
- Lethargic and fatigued by people and provlems?
- As if you are going though the ministry motions, and lack any kind of sustaining motivation?
- That there is too much to do and not enough time?

### A biblical snapshot of self-care and service

<details>

<summary>Mark 1:29-42 (HCSB)</summary>

**29** As soon as they left the synagogue, they went into Simon and Andrew’s house with James and John. **30** Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told Him about her at once. **31** So He went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.

**32** When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all those who were sick and those who were demon-possessed. **33** The whole town was assembled at the door, **34** and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew Him.

**35** Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He got up, went out, and made His way to a deserted place. And He was praying there. **36** Simon and his companions went searching for Him. **37** They found Him and said, “Everyone’s looking for You!”

**38** And He said to them, “Let’s go on to the neighboring villages so that I may preach there too. This is why I have come.” **39** So He went into all of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

**40** Then a man with a serious skin disease came to Him and, on his knees, begged Him: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”

**41** Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. “I am willing,” He told him. “Be made clean.” **42** Immediately the disease left him, and he was healed.

**What do we learn about service?**

- What is service?
- Things don't always go smoothly
- Always being available
- The primary reason that Jesus performed miracles / heals was to preach the Gospel.
- There's more to do than time to do it.
- There's a time for service and time for not service.

**What do we learn about self-care (i.e. rest and refreshment)?**

- What is self-care?
- Going to a friends house.
- Prioritise rest.
- Alone for self-reflection.
- Jesus who is the Son of God took time to pray.

### Two blblical truths held in tension

1. As we love God with out whole heart, mind and spirit, and as we trust and as we trust and follow Jesus, we are to prioritise the love and service of others (Matthew 22:24-40)

2. God works for our good, so that we may flourish and thrive. The Bible uses the word 'shalom' - which captures concepts of completeness, holiness, tranquility, delight, and being in right relationship with God.

**Thoughts**

- We often forgo our real engagement with God with service for others.
- The tension comes when our demands of ministry doesn't match with our resources
- We need to keep the main thing the main thing.
- We worship ministry more than Jesus.
- Forgo the first love of Jesus for our capacity / identity in ministry.

### Keeping the main thing, the main thing

<details>
<summary>Luke 10:17-20 (HCSB)</summary>

**17** The Seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.”

**18** He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like a lightning flash. **19** Look, I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will ever harm you. **20** However, don’t rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

</details>

- The main things should be our relationship with God our King, Jesus as our brother and the Spirit as our Guide.

  > However, don’t rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

### Spiritual resources

- To flourish and thrive in our ministry service, meaningful and ongoing investment in personal spiritual resources is crucial.
- We need to engage with spiritual resources to flourish with our ministry

#### Spiritual resouces include

##### 1. Secure attachment to God.

- Experienced by a person's sense of self as worthy or likely to receive God's care.
- A sense of loving intimacy with God.
- God is experienced as a haven and refuge, where one does not fear abandonment or rejection.
- In the face of fear, one runs God for safety

##### 2. Collaborative religious coping.

- Religious coping relates to how one might engage their religious beliefs or behaviours to cope with stressful life circumstances.
- It involves working in partnership with God to engage in ministry tasks and to solve problems.
- One is able to drawer support and empowerment from God, whilst also maintaining personal agency.

##### 3. Sense of calling.

- Possessing the sense that one has been called, drawn, or guided into ministry service, for this is what I am meant (or even designed) to do"
- A continued and ongoing sense of calling throughout all stages of the ministry journey (rather than only at the beginning) is important for long-term engagement.

### Reflect and renew

#### As you think back over the past year:

1. What was your experience of god as a haven and refuge?
2. How and when did you draw upon God and engage with Him over a significant problem or roadblock (either in ministry or life generally)?
3. What evidence of spiritual growth can you identify?
4. Do you feel that God has called and designed you for this ministry? What evidence demonstrates this?

#### As you look forward to the coming year:

1. How do you desire to grow in your love, knowledge, and dependence of God?
2. What spiritual practices will you implement to develop and maintain motivation and energy for ministry?

### Integrated self-care

God has designed us to be an intricate interplay (dovetailing) and amalgamation (brining together as one) of soul, spirit and body.

<Callout type="info">
  We can only give out to others, if we ensure that we give to ourselves first.
  And if we give to ourselves generously, then we can serve generously.
</Callout>

#### Three areas of self-care:

1. **🍗 Eat**: We need to eat to nourish our bodies with what it needs, not just with what it wants.
2. **💤 Sleep**: Develop a sleep routine, to give your body a regular rhythm and restorative rest.
3. **🏃‍♂️ Exercise**: Get outside, get moving, get your heart rate up. Our brains thrive on movement.

### Reflect and renew

#### As you think back over the past year:

1. What are you thankful for and / or what gave you joy? (Try to think of specific examples.) Why did they have such an impact?

2. Who or what energised you and 'filled your tank'?

#### As you look forward to the coming year:

1. Note on the diagram below:
   a. Things that may drain energy from your tank (include ministry as well as other life circumstances) and
   b. Self-care strategies that you will implement to help fill your tank (think through eat, sleep, and exervice strategies)
